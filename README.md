This model aimed to develop an accurate and efficient system for diagnosing 
diabetes in patients using machine learning techniques which can be leveraged by 
doctors to assist in several ways. Different machine learning algorithms, such as 
logistic regression and KNNs were implemented and analyzed to give the best 
possible result. Our model was made by using regression techniques and further 
optimized to achieve the best possible performance
